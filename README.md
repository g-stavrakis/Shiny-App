# Stellar objects classifier

This app created as a classifier that uses decision tree and random forrest methods in order to classify stellar objects into 3 classes: Stars, Galaxies or Quasars.

The aim of this app is to present to clients with little knowledge about machine learning, on how these two methods work and what are the outcomes of the analysis of the chosen training data.

# Dataset

The dataset based on which the classifier was build upon can be found in Kaggle in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17).

The data consists of 100,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.

The dataset was created from [Federico Soriano](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano)
